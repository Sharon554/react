props:
props is ntg but properties similar to html attributes,'
props is an object
props is an object used to exchange parent component to child component

state:
*******
-state is a mutable object whereas props is imutable 
state is an mutable object which is used to store / isolate the data inside the component.

class component:
***************
-class component 


functional component:
by defaalt functional component stateless because there is no state object
in react v16.8 they introduce a concept called as Hooks.

Hooks: Hooks is nothing but a function which implememnt all the feactures of class into functional components

basics hooks are:
1.useState()
2.useEffect()
3.useContext()

syntax : const[state , setState]=useState(initialValue);
state -it will store intial initialValuesetstate-it will


Tight coupling
one is dependent

functional : stateless

class: stateful component


props:
state: class

private->constructor


class extends Component{
    constructor(){

    }
}


props: properties or attributes
state:storage private data private to ur class


controlled componenets:
**********************
changing the functionality 

form handling:
<form action='myscript.js'>
checking the data
<form>
<input type='text>
</form>


2. useEffect():
**************

-it allows developers to make necessary changes/side effects insdie the component.
syntax: useEffect(callbackfn, dependency);

listv & keys: every listed items from the array should have a unique key prop value so it can track all the vhanges done in the lists.



react.fragment:
**************
this will act as a parent element for the jsx element and we can give key prop for this

3.usecontext():
 ************
-ref should be avoid using more
-ref is used to target native/real DOM elements.


4.usecontext();
**************
-to avoid props drilling we use context api.
this hook is used
